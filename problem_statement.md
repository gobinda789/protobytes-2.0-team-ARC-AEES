# Problem Statement: The Silent Threat of Power Quality Disturbances and Inefficient Loads

## The Invisible Problems Damaging Our Grid
In modern electrical systems, **power quality issues** are the silent killers of equipment and efficiency. Disturbances such as **voltage sags, swells, harmonics, transients, and poor power factor** operate invisibly, causing:
-   **Premature Equipment Failure**: Sensitive electronics and expensive machinery degrade faster.
-   **Significant Energy Losses**: Inefficient power usage leads to higher utility bills and wasted energy.
-   **Reduced System Reliability**: Unexpected downtime disrupts critical operations.

Traditional monitoring systems are **reactive and limited**—they often fail to identify the *root cause* of these issues. They treat all loads the same, unable to distinguish between a linear heater and a harmonic-polluting Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS). This "blind spot" leaves facility managers unaware of which specific devices are destabilizing their power network.

## The Solution: AI-Based Smart Power Quality Analyzer
We propose a **Smart Power Quality Analyzer** that moves beyond simple monitoring to **intelligent diagnostics**. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence, our system provides:

1.  **Intelligent Load Classification**: Automatically identifies the *type* of load connected (e.g., Induction Motor, SMPS, LED Driver) based on its unique electrical signature.
2.  **Harmonic Source Detection**: Pinpoints whether a fault originates from the utility grid (Source) or the facility's own equipment (Load).
3.  **Actionable Optimizations**: Recommends specific solutions (e.g., "Install Capacitor Bank" or "Check Transformer Tap") rather than just displaying raw data.

### Dual-Input Capability for Maximum Flexibility
Our system is designed for both real-world analysis and educational simulation:
-   **CSV Data Upload**: Accepts real-world waveform data files for detailed post-event analysis.
-   **Real-Time Simulation**: Allows manual input of electrical parameters to simulate various load conditions and disturbances instantly, enabling users to test "what-if" scenarios safely.

### Impact and Innovation
This AI-driven approach transforms power quality management from a passive monitoring task into a pro-active strategy. It enables **early fault detection**, **predictive maintenance**, and **data-driven energy optimization**, ensuring a more reliable and efficient electrical infrastructure for the future.
