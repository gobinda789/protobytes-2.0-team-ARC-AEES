# ⚡Smart Power Quality Analyzer (AI Load Classification)


---

## 📌 Project Details

### 🏷 Project Title  
**AI-Based Smart Power Quality Analyzer with Load Classification (Simulation Only)**

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Power quality disturbances (voltage sag, swell, harmonics, and unstable loads) reduce efficiency and can damage equipment in industries, smart buildings, and distribution networks.

Most traditional power quality analyzers:
- only show measurements,
- do not classify loads,
- and do not provide intelligent insights for decision-making.

There is a need for an AI-assisted system that monitors signals, detects disturbances, and classifies load types to support smarter energy management.

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project is a **simulation-based smart power quality analyzer** that:

- Simulates voltage and current waveforms for different load conditions  
- Extracts key electrical features (RMS, active/reactive power, power factor, THD, etc.)  
- Detects power quality disturbances  
- Uses Machine Learning models to classify load types  
- Provides visual analysis for monitoring and reporting
